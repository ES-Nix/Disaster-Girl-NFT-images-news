> The next gap that exists there's a gap that is building in our society and there's an invention as
you would imagine that fills that gap that invention is called blockchain.

> I want to talk about is what is the gap that it feels so that we can look forward and see what the world could
look like and take advantage of it blood change is something that is very fundamental to us it's at the core of
who we are and each of us do it hundreds of times a day what blockchain is going to change it's just going to 
change the way we trust not just how we trust each other but more specifically how we trust in business I want
to talk about is what is the gap that it feels so that we can look forward and see what the world could look 
like and take advantage of it blood change is something that is very fundamental to us it's at the core of who we 
are and each of us do it hundreds of times a day what blockchain is going to change it's just going to change 
the way we trust not just how we TRUST each other but more specifically how we trust in BUSINESS.

"Every company in the world today, not just the intermediaries, are at risk of having competition 
from a blockchain version of themselves"

> Let's talk how we manufacture trust today in order to talk about trust so that you can really get a sense as to 
what I mean by blockchain is going to change the way we trust let's imagine that we're about to buy a house now we
have invented this thing in society called the ledger.

> Today as a civilization when we start companies or we start transactions we start with an automatic assumption that
the counterparty cannot be trusted when we start companies or we start transactions today we start with the automatic

> Today as a civilization when we start companies or we start transactions we start with an automatic assumption that
> the counterparty cannot be trusted when we start companies or we start transactions today we start with the automatic
> assumption that the counterparty cannot be trusted. It almost feels normal to us kind of feels like oh yeah I mean
> why would we not do that what does it have to be that way it's just something that we've become accustomed to and
> the way we've gone about it is we establish these things called intermediaries - fancy word for middlemen and middle
> women intermediaries these are entities that are responsible for keeping a centralized copy of the ledgers in all
> of Commerce and they facilitate the brokering of the relationship between those who are looking to trust and those
> who are looking to be trusted examples of intermediaries are things like banks a Department of Motor Vehicle it's a 
> great intermediary for identity mortgage title companies credit reporting agencies these are all intermediaries this 
> is just a small example of the intermediaries that we deal with today and the reason why we deal with them is because 
>  we simply can't trust the ledgers that we have now the intermediaries don't actually get us all the way there.

> Not everybody believes in God, not everybody believes in human rights, not everybody believes in nationalism, 
but everybody believes in money, and in the dollar bill. Take, even, Osama Bin Laden. He hated American politics
and American religion and American culture, but he had no objection to American dollars. He was quite fond of
them, actually.

> O Ethereum tem uma linguagem determinística. O que eu quero dizer com isto? Uma linguagem deterministica é que se 
eu executar o mesmo código em máquinas diferentes ele vai executar do mesmo jeito na mesma sequência produzir 
o mesmo resultado.

>It should be sufficient for self hosting a development environment, remember a significant part of the point of the
exercise is so that the smartphone can be independent of the PC so that it can replace the PC so that we can actually
use smartphones as workstations. If it can't rebuild the OS that's on the phone itself your development environment
is not real. [Embedded Linux Conference 2013 - Toybox: Writing a New Command Line From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/embed/SGmtP5Lg_t0?start=1541&end=1564&version=3)


> Phones and computers are never seen as comparable when it comes to power they both live in different worlds
though as long time subscribers would know back in 2012 i was comparing the two of them and seeing if a phone 
could replace a pc the rate at which phone power was improving year over year was absolutely unbelievable to 
me at the time those were some fun days the main difference between phones and desktop computers is that they 
use different types of processor technology phones use a type of processor design called arm while desktop 
computers generally use another type called x86 like intel for example.
